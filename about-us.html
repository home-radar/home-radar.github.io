            <h1>About our ratings</h1>
            <h3>Knowledge from us to you</h3>
            <p>Our rating system is based on reports and reviews of maintenance, management, pest control, and general happiness of tenants. We collect information from tenants through interviews, surveys, and online reviews to best understand what they love and hate about where they live. To improve out ratings, submit a rating about your apartment!

                <!-- Three stars ★★★ means there are none (or very, very few) negative reports. The quality of the apartment is very high for most tenants.
                Two stars ★★☆ means negative reports exist, but there are also some positives. These apartments often have a mixed bag of reports.
                One star ★☆☆ means there are serious health, safety, cleanliness, or security problems with the apartment that impede many tenants. -->
